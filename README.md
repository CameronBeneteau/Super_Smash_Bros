## Intro

This is a two-player crossover fighting game inspired by the classic arcade game [Super Smash Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.).

This game was made using Java. It utilizes object-oriented programming and other computing techniques learned throughout high school.

## Results

I am extremely happy I was able to participate in MasseyHacks IV to build this project.

The 24-hour time constraint was easily the hardest but most enjoyable part of this experience.

It was a big challenge to try to build a game this fast, but it kept me on my feet and forced me to think of neat and creative ways to overcome the various challenges I faced through this development process.

There are definitely some things I would like to go back and change/clean up!

Although this game did not win any prizes at the hackathon, it was awesome to see my creation come to life - especially after letting the judges and other hackers play against each other!

## Next Steps
Some fun things I would like to build on or explore relating to this project would be:

- Develop enemy AI characters for users to play against
- Allow players to choose various characters
- Have multiple types of attacks and combos
- Add sound effects to various in-game events (attack, jump, death, etc.)
