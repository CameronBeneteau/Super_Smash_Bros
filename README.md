## Intro

This is a two-player crossover fighting game inspired by the classic arcade game [Super Smash Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.).

This game was made using Java. It utilizes object-oriented programming and other computing techniques learned throughout high school.

## Next Steps
Some fun things I would like to build on or explore relating to this project would be:

- Ability for players to customize their tank
- Ability for players to choose different map themes
- Display previous shot trajectory and info to help users make their next shot more precise
- Controls icons next to power and angle text fields in case users forget their controls
- 
- 
- Add sound effects to various in-game events (attack, jump, death, etc.)
